### Procedure:-

●Clean the conducting glass ITO substrate by sonicating it in a detergent solution for 10 minutes, ethanol for 20 minutes, and distilled water for 30 minutes.
<br>
●Prepare the precursor solution by mixing 0.0125 M sodium tungstate dehydrate, 0.015 M hydrogen peroxide, and 0.5 M nitric acid solution.
<br>
●Pour the solution into the electrochemical cell and set the three-electrode system using ITO as a working electrode, Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference electrode, and Pt electrode as a counter electrode, respectively.
<br>
●The amperometric method was optimized by keeping a constant potential at  0.5 V and varying deposition time. 
<br>
●	The graph shows the photocurrent response from water oxidation of the ITO/WO3 electrode prepared with the amperometric method with various deposition times of 15 min, 30 min, and 45 minutes.
